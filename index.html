                        I originally hail from Hesston, KS, a small town about 40 minutes north of Wichita. 
                        I graduated from Hesston High School in 2007. I moved to Manhattan, KS where I attended 
                        Kansas State University earning a BS in Management Information Systems. 
                        After working in Manhattan for a couple years I moved to Wichita, KS.

                        My first professional Job was for Information Technology Services at K-State 
                        doing Desktop Support. After getting a great opportunity, I moved to Wichita, 
                        KS where I worked for Conco Construction as a Systems Administrator. 
                        I currently work at Wichita State University as a Data Warehousing Analyst.

                        I enjoy riding my bicycle and go for a few rides a week. I love to keep 
                        up with tech news, from the newest CPUs and GPUs to cell phones, space 
                        or anything in-between. On the weekend I'm usually hanging out with 
                        friends and dogs. I'm a PC Gamer and enjoy playing a host of different 
                        games as well as watching my fair share of eSports.

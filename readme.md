## Ben Janzen's Website

This is the source for the website BenJanzen.com.  It is currently a work in progess!  This version of the website is not currently live, and will take place of that GUI generated thing that's currently at my personal website.

#### Phase 1

Phase 1 will include the following pages:
* Home (Index)
* Resume
* About
* My Work (Link to GitHub)

Phase 2 will include the following pages:
* Contact
* Working Projects

##### Home

The index page for the website.  This will include the following main sections:

* Main Header with awesome picture of my majestic dog Galio, including my name and current title.
* Followed by some basic general info about myself.
  * Sections are a brief history about me, places I've worked, and what I enjoy doing.

##### Resume

This page will include my resume, with some nifty stuff to make it more pretty than my current resume.

There will be a phase 2 here, as I will update the resume later with a printable option, or possibly a pdf download version.  unsure of that for now, as that will be later.

##### About

This is a page I do not have in my current website.  I'll put some info out there about myself.  Note to self: Make sure to include cycling, fiddling with cars, tech news and taking my dog for long walks ~~on the beach~~ around the neighborhood.

##### Contact

This page will be part of phase 2 and will include a contact form to send me an email about... whatever.  This is on the current page, but since I'm migrating to something I've actually written, not just dragged and dropped, I'd like to get the page up and running before getting a contact system in place.

This will probably require me to dig into some javascript, or maybe I can do it in python... we'll mess with that when we get there.

##### My Work

This is just a hyperlink to my github page... simple enough.

##### Working Projects

At some point, I'll get a project I'm working on in python to a point where I am ready to share it with the world.  At that point I'll put it in place on my website.  So this hinges on me finishing one of my 3 or 4 personal python projects.
